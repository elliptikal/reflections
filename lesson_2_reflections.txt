What happens when you initialize a repository?
	
	When you initialize a repository, it creates a .git folder in the repository. This folder would be used to store the history of the files and directories in the repository.

Why do you need to do it?

	You need to do it to enable Git track and store the commit histories of the files in the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is a temporary location where files are added before using git commit to add them to the repository. It's like "limbo" :-)

	The staging area gives the flexibility of deciding what files to add to the commit, therefore, it helps to split each commit into logical changes.
