When would you want to create a remote repository  rather than keep all your work locally?

  I would want to create a remote repository when I want to collaborate with others, or when I want to make my code or changes in my code availabel to others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your repository?

	I would perfer to pull changes manually because it allows me decide what changes I want to sync with the remote location. Also it helps me prevent unwanted changes to the local repository when someone else has made changes to the remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Branches happen on a single repo
	
	Cloning involves taking an existing repo and making one like it. The original can be either local or on GitHub, however, the duplicate verion of the repo is usually on a local machine. That is, you can either clone from GitHub to your local machine, or from your local machine to another location on your local machine.
	
	Forking is usually cloning from one GitHub repo to a copy of another GitHub repo

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last know state of the remote stored locally?

	This enables you to compare the last state of the remote to the latest commit of the master branch and resolve conflicts before you merge and push to the remote.
